<h1>K- Nearest Neighbors Analysis</h1>
<p>
  The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a non-parametric, supervised
  learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or
  predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. It is one of the
  popular and simplest classification and regression classifiers used in machine
  learning today.
