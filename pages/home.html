<h1>Smart Student - Project Overview</h1>
<p>
  SmartStudent is a Web Development + Data Science track combined TECHLABS -
  Final Project, where 3 members from Data Science (2) and WEB Development (1)
  track will be working together to create a full stack web application using
  different DS and WEB tools.
</p>
<h2>‚úçÔ∏è Project Description</h2>
<p>
  Students Academic performance is shaped by more than just test scores.
  Behaviour, attendance, social interactions, and family background all play
  crucial roles in student outcomes. Yet, without proper tools, educators may
  lack the full picture of a student‚Äôs needs.
</p>
<p>
  Smart Student uses data science / Web tools and techniques to analyse these
  diverse data points and generate insights that can predict student
  performance. By recognizing patterns in behaviour and engagement, the project
  provides educators and administrators with actionable information to support
  every student‚Äôs academic journey.

<h2>üéØ Applications and Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Teachers:</strong> Use insights to identify students who may be
    struggling early in the semester, providing them with timely support and
    personalized guidance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>School Administrators:</strong> Adjust curriculums or allocate
    resources based on insights from the model, ensuring they meet the needs of
    diverse student populations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Parents and Students:</strong> With regular reports, parents and
    students can gain a clear understanding of how behaviours affect academic
    performance, making it easier to adopt productive study habits.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Education Tech Developers:</strong> Smart Student provides a foundation to
    build adaptive learning platforms that respond dynamically to a student‚Äôs
    behavioural data, fostering more personalized learning experiences.
